# Gradle Configuration Cache Hackathon 2022

The configuration and execution phase of builds always take the longest. You may already know about the build cache, which saves execution time by reusing outputs from past builds. The new [configuration cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html) reuses configuration results from past builds to speed up the configuration phase.

If you keep an eye on Gradle updates via the [Github Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/32), you've probably noticed lots of work on the configuration cache. This feature is almost finished incubating -- expect to see a stable release soon.

Interested in contributing? Now is the time! For the month of September, we are hosting the Configuration Cache Hackathon. Join us for the [kickoff event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHxoQeKddEg) on September 1 at 9am PDT / 1pm BRT / 4pm GMT.

At the kickoff event, you'll learn how to contribute to Gradle Build Tool. Gradle is the build tool of choice for millions of developers around the globe. It's also the official build tool for Android applications.

During this month-long event, you can interact directly with Gradle Build Tool engineers when you contribute. The primary focus of this event will be to fix the Gradle documentation snippets so they become compatible with the configuration cache.

We have provided a [suggested workflow](workflow.md) as a simple guide for Hackathon participants, and a [FAQ](faq.md) to answer your most common questions. 

Join us on the [Gradle Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gradle-community/shared_invite/zt-1bbiqbuxw-CgB0NeNaK_zuDMEa71A60Q) [#configuration-cache](https://app.slack.com/client/TA7ULVA9K/C013WEPGQF9) channel for support. 

We are also hosting a live Q&A session on September 8 for all Hackathon Participants to answer your questions.

Starting on September 1st, check out the [Hackathon board](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43/) to claim open issues to work on. Claim issues and get your PRs in fast. On September 30th, voting starts! 

Make sure you read the [rules](rules.md).  Everyone that has an accepted submission will get a configuration cache t-shirt. The Gradle Build Tool community will pick the best 3 PRs and those winners can choose a shirt with a commemorative design.
