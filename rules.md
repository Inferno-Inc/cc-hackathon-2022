# Configuration Cache Hackathon Rules

## First you need to claim an issue

- Contestants should look through the [`Unclaimed Issues`](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43) lane and comment on the issue they want to claim.
- The Gradle team will review the claim, assign it and move it to the [`Claimed Issues`](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43) lane.
- Your 72 hour timer starts!


## Working on Issues

- Each contestant can only have one claimed issue at a time. 
- There is a 72 hour limit for progress on an issue.  That is after claiming an issue some progress needs to happen within 72 hours or the issue will be moved back into [`Unclaimed Issues`](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43).  The PR does NOT need to be [`Ready for Review`](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43) just progress towards a solution.
- If you need help or are stuck, add a comment in your PR and the Gradle team will move it to the [`Blocked - HELP`](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43) lane.


## Ready for submit

- Mark PR "ready to review" to submit the solution and the Gradle team will review.  
- After you submit your review it is important for you to be responsive to the review. You have 48 hours to respond to all review issues. 


## Importance of time

There are many issues to resolve in just 1 month! It is important to have a sense of urgency with both claimed PRs and Reviews. There is a 72 hour time for progress towards an issue and a 48 hour time to respond to a review. If either of these times are not met the issue will go back to the [`Unclaimed Issues`](https://github.com/orgs/gradle/projects/43) lane for another contestant. 



## Who gets the swag

To get swag you need to have an accepted PR.  Part of that is following the above process and time frame.  If you need to deviate from the process please contact the Gradle team on GitHub or [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/gradle-community/shared_invite/zt-1bbiqbuxw-CgB0NeNaK_zuDMEa71A60Q) [#configuration-cache](https://app.slack.com/client/TA7ULVA9K/C013WEPGQF9).
